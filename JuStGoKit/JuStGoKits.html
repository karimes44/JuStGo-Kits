<h1>JuStGo Kits</h1>

<h2>What are JuStGo Kits?</h2>
<!-- {{{ ---><div class="txt">
<p>Each JuStGo kit contains all you need to build a game or an application from scratch.</p>

<p>It is helpful if you know a little bit about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but don't worry, the kits contain links to helpful resources to catch up on what you need to build the game or even to <em>learn as you go!</em></p>

<p>The kit also contains tips and explanations that help you complete the task. At the end, a solution proposal is given for this task. You can decide for yourself if you want to continue with your own solution, switch to the provided one, or to mix-and-match.</p>

<p>The provided proposal solution solves the task with very little code so that you can clearly see what is done and how. As a consequence, it may look a bit plain. Let this inspire you to spice it up!<br/>
Go wild with CSS and add HTML elements as you like. Make it yours!</p>

<p>Just like with a Lego kit, you can take the building blocks from the JuStGo kits and reassemble them <em>your</em> way, either to make a game from a kit better or even to create your own game. At the end of each kit you will find challenges and ideas for that.</p>

<p>You can work with JuStGo kits on any browser and any OS, but you will need a code/text editor. Check out some recommendations <a href= "#TecRec">here</a>. </p>

<h3>Did you attend the <a href= "codenation.org">Code Nation</a> <q>Intro to Web Development</q> class?</h3>

<p>If so, you can think of the first two JuStGo kits as a refresher, as they cover a similar set of content.</p>

<p>... but there are difference:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The JuStGo kits only use JavaScript instead of jQuery. Don't worry, all you can do with jQuery, you can do with JavaScript, and you'll gain a deeper understanding on what is going on.</li>
	<li>JuStGo kits are written to run locally and not on a web service, like   PopCode, but you can create your projects inside PopCode, if you like.</li>
</ul>

<p>You see, even if you completed the <q>Intro to Web Development</q> class, you will find new things in the first two kits.</p>

<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
<!-- {{{ ---><div class="txt">
<!-- _______________________________________________________________ -->
<p>The games and apps you will write will run on <em>any</em> browser and you can use any text editor to write the games and apps.</p>

<p>You can use a PC, a Mac, or a Chrome Book (... even a Linux box) to write the games and apps.</p>

<p>On mobile devices like Smart Phones and Tablets you can <em>run</em> the games, but you can't really write them there. That's because it is hard to find good text editors for mobile devices and the mobile browser don't have <em>Developer Tools</em>.</p>

<h3>Recommended Browser</h3>

<p><b>Google Chrome</b> works pretty well as the browser, and it support a good  code editor as an free app (see below).</p>

<p>If you don't already have the Google Chrome browser, you and download and install it from: <br/>
<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank"> https://www.google.com/chrome</a></p>

<h3>Recommended Text Editor</h3>

<p>If you don't have a favorite text and code editor, check out <b>Caret</b>. You can get the <b>Caret</b> editor from <a href="http://thomaswilburn.net/caret/"  target="_blank"> thomaswilburn.net/caret/</a>. On this page, look for:</p>

<blockquote><em>
<h4>Getting Caret</h4>
<p>If you're running Chrome, you can install Caret directly from the <a href= "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml"  target="_blank"> Chrome Web Store</a>. [...]</p>
</em></blockquote>

<p>Once you installed <b>Caret</b>, you can start it from the <b>Apps</b> bookmark, or by typing <tt>chrome://apps</tt> in the Chrome URL address bar.</p>

<h3>Developer Tools</h3>

<p>When you write code, it is <em>very</em> normal that it does not quite work the first time (<em>...like never!</em>), and frankly, figuring out what is wrong can be confusing (sigh) - but also a fun challenge! <br>
So, don't get discouraged, there are simple things you can do to get your code to start working right.</p>

<p>For example, you can check the value of some variables that don't quite do what you expected in a pop-up alert <code>alert(rogueVariable)</code> or with a  <code>console.log(rogueVariable)</code> statements in the JavaScript code. You can un-comment (=make them active again) them as needed or add new once to show the variables you are confused about.</p>

<p>There are also the <b>Developer Tools</b> - most browsers have them built-in. In <b>Chrome</b> you can activate the Developer Tools with <tt>Ctrl-Shift-i</tt>, or from the customization tab &gt; <em>More Tools</em> &gt; <em>Developer tools</em>.</p>

<p>The  <b>Console</b> panel in the Developer Tool window you can see a list of all coding mistakes that prevent the code from running at all.</p>

<p><b>Another Tip:</b> Browsers are designed to "muddle through" if there is an error on some Web page. When your code behaves like "totally weird", it may just be that there is a mistake in your code somewhere else and the browser just tried to limp along. Check in the <b>Developer Tools</b> if you can find any hints of what may have tripped up the browser.</p>

<p>In the <b>Source</b> panel you can step through the running code and see all the variables with their current values and see in which order your code statements are executed. Then you learn pretty quick why things are not quite working as you wanted. And once you know what is going wrong - fixing it is often the easy part!</p>

<p>If you need a quick intro to the <b>Chrome Developer Tools</b>, search for a video on YouTube, like for example this one:
<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0XScE08hy8" target="_blank">Debugging JavaScript - Chrome DevTools 101</a>.</p>
