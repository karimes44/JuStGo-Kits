<h1>JuStGo Kits</h1>

<h2>What are JuStGo Kits?</h2>
<!-- {{{ ---><div class="txt">
<p>Each JuStGo kit contains all you need to build a game from scratch.</p>

<p>It is helpful if you know a little bit about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but don't worry, the kits contain links to helpful resources to catch up on what you need to build the game or even to <em>learn as you go!</em></p>

<p>The kit also contains tips and explanations that help you complete the task. At the end, a solution proposal is given for this task. You can decide for yourself if you want to continue with your own solution, switch to the provided one, or to mix-and-match.</p>

<p>The provided proposal solution solves the task with very little code so that you can clearly see what is done and how. As a consequence, it may look a bit plain. Let this inspire you to spice it up!<br/>
Go wild with CSS and add HTML elements as you like. Make it yours!</p>

<p>Just like with a Lego kit, you can take the building blocks from the JuStGo kits and reassemble them <em>your</em> way, either to make a game from a kit better or even to create your own game. At the end of each kit you will find challenges and ideas for that.</p>
